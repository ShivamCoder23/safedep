### Point to note
>[!NOTE]
>Currently the data used for visual insight is used by mock data retrieved from ```sampledata.json```. The safedep insights api is setup properly using server side rendering in page directory.
Due to disallowed access to the api its been commented out. But that can be used instead of mock data when we will hit the api.
